                </h2>
            <p>I did my highschool Education at Starehe Boy's Centre and school from the year 2019AD to 2022AD.
                I emerged with an A- at the end of the four years and decided to take Computer Science at the University of Nairobi, due to
                my passion in Tech, where I am currently studying.
